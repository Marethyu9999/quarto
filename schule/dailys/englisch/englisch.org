** Synopsis

  - in terms of regions and history
- generally just checking the EVA-HA
** Disparities in Nigeria
*** Pictures from p.240
1. A city is visible with relativly flat land (most likely suburbs)
   in the distance is a haven with compared to the houses big ships
2. a few market stalls directly beside a street entirely filled with people leaving little gaps
   also containing many vehicles in an almost random order
3. a old building built out of either concrete or stone with a clock tower, old build style (gothic I guess)
   a few people and a few market stalls are before the building, an office building in the background
4. a deforested /forest/ with some sort of gas or steam, was most likely abundant in ressources before but then exploited
   charred trees with no leaves, a gas or fluid pipe emitting this steam/gas substance, a little stream of water coming from beyond the pipe
5. a village made out of wood, sourrounded by green trees/plants going into a vast, green landscape
   they don't seem to have any electrical devices but the /modern/ houses which stand after the hay-made huts

In summary Nigeria is *full of disparities*
** Checking if EVA-HW is present
